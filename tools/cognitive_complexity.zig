//! Cognitive complexity linter for Zig source, and the check behind the CLAUDE.md rule that a
//! function stays at cognitive complexity 15 or less.
//!
//! Run:  zig build lint, which passes `--max 15` and build.zig, build, src and tools.
//!
//! The scorer is pepegrillo's (decision 7): SonarSource Cognitive Complexity mapped onto Zig, with
//! every function and every `test` block scored, one line per declaration over the threshold, in
//! the shape the Zig compiler prints an error,
//!
//!     path:line:column: error: [cognitive-complexity] name scored SCORE (max N)
//!
//! and a summary line when nothing is over it. The threshold and the paths come from build.zig, so
//! this entry point configures nothing.
