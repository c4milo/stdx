//! file-length: a hand-written source file stays at or under 500 lines, its tests included
//! (CLAUDE.md, Conventions). Split the file rather than raise the limit, and name every piece
//! after the file it came from: `zstd.zig` becomes `zstd_frame.zig`, `zstd_block.zig`, and so
//! on, keeping the original name as the entry point.
//!
//! Over every `.zig` and `.sh` file under `src/`, `tools/`, `build/` and `bench/`, the rule counts
//! lines the way an editor numbers them, one per newline plus one for a last line with no newline,
//! and reports a file over the limit once, at the first line past it.
//!
//! Markdown is exempt: a document's audited unit is the section, not the file, and the design set
//! is deliberately long.
//!
//! The rule is pepegrillo's `file_length` (decision 7). This file holds stdx's configuration of it
//! and the fixtures that pin that configuration.
