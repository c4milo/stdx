//! stdx lint: the rules of CLAUDE.md and docs/invariants.md that a parser and a line scanner can
//! check, one file per rule under tools/lint/.
//!
//! Run:  zig build lint, which passes no `--rule`, so every rule registered here runs and checks.
//! `--rule NAME` runs one rule by hand.
//!
//! The driver is pepegrillo's (decision 7): it walks every PATH, hands every regular file to every
//! enabled rule, reports a `.zig` file that does not parse under the `parse` pseudo-rule, and prints
//! one line per finding, sorted by path, line, column and rule, in the shape the Zig compiler prints
//! an error:
//!
//!     path:line:column: error: [rule-name] message
//!
//! A PATH under the working directory is read relative to it, so the build's absolute paths
//! report as `src/...`.
//! Exit status: 0 when nothing was found, 1 when any finding was reported or a file failed to read,
//! 2 on a usage error.
//!
//! Ten rules are pepegrillo's, configured in the file named after each. `module-graph`,
//! `rfc-citation` and `input-index` are stdx's own, written against pepegrillo's readers.
//!
//! This tool is developer tooling. It is never linked into the library, so it allocates, reads the
//! filesystem, and is exempt from the rules it enforces over `src/` (CLAUDE.md, Layout).
