//! markdown: every Markdown file is GitHub-flavored Markdown and must render on GitHub as written
//! (CLAUDE.md, Conventions). A document that renders wrong is read wrong, and the design set is
//! the thing every later step is measured against.
//!
//! Over every `.md` file, the rule makes four checks:
//!   1. a bare pseudo list item: a line that starts with digits, one letter, a period and a space,
//!      such as `3b. ` or `0a. `. GitHub folds it into the paragraph above instead of rendering a
//!      list item, so the step it names disappears. Nest it as a list item.
//!   2. a fenced code block opened with no language: ``` with nothing after it. GitHub renders it
//!      unhighlighted, and CLAUDE.md requires a language on every fence.
//!   3. a table row whose column count differs from its header's. GitHub drops the extra cells and
//!      pads the missing ones, silently. Cells are split on every `|` that no backslash escapes,
//!      the way GitHub splits them, so a `|` written inside a code span counts as a cell boundary
//!      here exactly as it does there.
//!   4. trailing whitespace: a line ending in a space or a tab. Two trailing spaces are a hard
//!      line break in Markdown, which is invisible in the source and changes the render.
//!
//! Checks 1, 2 and 3 skip the inside of a fenced code block, where the text is not Markdown. Check
//! 4 does not: trailing whitespace inside a fence is still trailing whitespace in the file.
//!
//! What the rule does not check: the rest of the GFM rules CLAUDE.md names — no definition lists,
//! no LaTeX, a pipe inside a table cell written `\|` — and the render itself. It reads lines, not
//! a document tree, so a table written without its outer pipes, or a fence opened inside a list
//! item's indentation, is outside what it can see.
//!
//! The rule is pepegrillo's `markdown` (decision 7). This file holds stdx's configuration of it
//! and the fixtures that pin that configuration.
