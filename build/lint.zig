//! `zig build lint`: the cognitive-complexity score, then the tools/lint rules over the tree, then
//! the same rules over a canary tree. build.zig stays short (CLAUDE.md, Layout), so the wiring
//! is in this file.
//!
//! The rules run with no `--rule` argument, so every rule tools/lint/main.zig registers checks the
//! build. A clean tree cannot show that: a run that dropped a rule passes a tree that rule would
//! have passed anyway. The canary tree shows it. It is a tree written into the build cache holding
//! one violation of every rule, and the lint must exit 1 over it and print each rule of
//! `canary_rules` on stdout. Both runs take their arguments from `add_rules_run`, so a change to
//! how the rules are selected applies to the canary too.
